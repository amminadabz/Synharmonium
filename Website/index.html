                <h2>Description</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Imagine an instrument that can play in perfect just intonation on any melody, in any harmonic context, in any key, with any tuning offset, with an interface that makes it dead easy to make good music. Now imagine that it can act as a midi controller for your other instruments, bringing that same great tuning and usability with it. </p>
                <p>That is what the Synharmonium aspires to be: the beginning of a new era of music making. Or at the very least, a fun little synthesizer with a unique control scheme that you can put together yourself.</p>
                <p>This instrument will be what you make it. That is to say, you have the oppurtunity to help design and develop it, and your funding will be essential to getting this project of the ground, so head over to GitHub and contribute to the design if you can, or send us a donation through PayPal.</p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The Synharmonium includes aspects of the accordion, the Omnichord, and the piano to give you several easy ways to play. It has a bass keyboard like an accordion, which allows you to play any chord with a single key. From the Omnichord, it takes the strum plate, allowing you to give your chords texture. A familiar piano keyboard is included for playing melodies. With this combination, you can play solo or accompany other instruments. With USB and MIDI output, it can also be connected to a computer to control any digital or software instrument.</p>
                <p>This instrument is programmed with an algorithm that uses just tuning to ensure that each note is mathematically related to each chord played, unlike other instruments that use equal temperament. This can always be disabled in order to accompany and play alongside other instruments.</p>
                <p>Every part of the Synharmonium is open source. The algorithm and synthesis runs on an Arduino compatible microcontroller, which is beginner-friendly and easily modifiable. This gives any musician the ability to cater to their own needs and modify their instrument as they see fit. This also means that anyone could build their own version of the Synharmonium. An official version is in the making as a preassembled machine and a kit.</p>
