# UIW Brand Style Guide

## Typography

A sort of neoclassical typography, Like a modern, subtly satirical interpretation of traditional newsprint. Titles and paragraphs should be kept level, but blurbs may be placed at diagonals to add a playful air. Almost all text should be in black or white, with some exceptions for grayscale or colorful blurbs.

**Logos and Titles:** Serif: Playfair Display, regular and italics

**Headings, interfaces, hardware** Sans: Inter

**Paragraphs** Serif: EB Garamond

## Colors

Like newsprint, written materials are to be largely black and white. Accents of red may be used to a moderate degree, and any given piece of material may have no more than one rainbow stripe(in discrete bars like commodore or apple or the pride flag). Colors should be saturated, but not too bright.
